## What is this?

My source code for the deep learning course offered by Professor Andrew Ng. Concretely, I have implemented the following:

### Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

**Week 2:** Learnt Numpy basics. Implemented Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset.

**Week 3** Implemented planar data classfication with one hidden layer (including forward and backprop) using Numpy.

**Week 4:** Built a *deep neural network* for image classification.

### Course 2: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularisation, and Optimisation

**Week 1:** Implemented *initialization* and *regularisation techniques*, *gradient checking* using Numpy.

**Week 2:** Implemented *mini-batch, momentum gradient descent and Adam* using Numpy.

**Week 3:** Learnt *Tensorflow*.

### Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

**Week 1:** Build a *ConvNet* in *TensorFlow* for a classfication problem

**Week 2:** Build a ConvNet using *ResNets* with *Keras*.

**Week 3:** Build *object detection (car) system* using *YOLO model*.

**Week 4:** Build a *face recognition system.* Implemented *neural style transfer* algorithm on art.

### Course 5:

**Week 1:** Built a *RNN*. Improvise a Jazz solo with a *LSTM Network*.

**Week 2:** Built an Emojifier (appends emoji to an input sentence based on its meaning) using *word vectors.*

**Week 3:** Built a Neural Machine Translation using *attention model*. Built *Trigger Word Detection model.*
